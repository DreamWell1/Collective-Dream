        In a real deployment with a valid API key, this would connect to the 
        DeepSeek API and return an actual generated response. For now, this
        placeholder text is shown instead.
        
        To use the actual DeepSeek API, please set the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
        environment variable with your API key.
